## Course Overview

This course teaches you everything about working with CSV files in Python, including:

- Understanding the CSV format and its variations
- Reading CSV files with the csv module and pandas
- Writing and creating CSV files
- Modifying and transforming CSV data
- Advanced techniques for large files
- Professional error handling and best practices
- Building a complete data processing application

## Key Features

- 8 comprehensive lessons with clear examples
- Hands-on exercises with provided sample data
- Complete solutions for all exercises
- Real-world capstone project
- Coverage of both csv module and pandas library
- Best practices for production code

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Basic Python knowledge (variables, functions, loops)
- Understanding of file I/O concepts
- Familiarity with data structures (lists, dictionaries)

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Check Your Python Version

```bash
python --version
# Should be 3.7 or higher
```

### Step 2: Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install pandas
```

The csv module is built-in, so no installation needed for that.

### Step 3: Download Sample Data

Sample CSV files are provided in the `sample-data/` directory. These are used throughout the exercises.

### Step 4: Start Learning

Follow the learning path outlined in `course-overview.md`. Start with Lesson 01 and progress sequentially.
