# Exercise Solutions

This directory contains complete solutions to all exercises throughout the course.

## Important Note

Try to solve the exercises yourself before looking at the solutions! The learning happens when you struggle with the problems. Use these solutions to:

1. Check your work after completing an exercise
2. Understand alternative approaches
3. Debug if you're stuck on a specific error
4. Learn best practices and code organization

## Solution Organization

Solutions are organized by lesson and exercise number:

- `lesson02_exercise01.py` - Lesson 2, Exercise 1 solution
- `lesson02_exercise02.py` - Lesson 2, Exercise 2 solution
- And so on...

## How to Use These Solutions

1. Complete the exercise on your own first
2. Run your code and test it thoroughly
3. Compare your solution with the provided one
4. Note any differences in approach or technique
5. Ask yourself: Which approach is clearer? More efficient? More maintainable?

## Learning from Solutions

When reviewing solutions, focus on:

- **Code structure**: How is the code organized?
- **Error handling**: What edge cases are handled?
- **Readability**: Is the code self-documenting?
- **Efficiency**: Are there performance optimizations?
- **Best practices**: What Python idioms are used?

Remember: There are usually multiple correct ways to solve a problem. Your solution might be different but equally valid!

## Sample Data

All solutions assume the sample data files in the `sample-data/` directory are available. Make sure to run solutions from the correct directory or adjust file paths as needed.
