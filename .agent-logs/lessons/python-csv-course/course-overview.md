## What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll create:
- A robust CSV data processor
- Tools for merging and transforming datasets
- Scripts that handle errors gracefully
- Memory-efficient processing for large files

## Resources Provided

- **sample-data/**: Practice CSV files for exercises
- **solutions/**: Complete solutions to all exercises
- **Quick reference guides** in each lesson

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed
2. Install required packages: `pip install pandas`
3. Download the sample data files
4. Start with Lesson 01

## Support Libraries

This course covers two main approaches:
- **csv module** (built-in): Lightweight, no dependencies
- **pandas**: Powerful, feature-rich, requires installation

You'll learn when to use each based on your specific needs.

## Learning Tips

- Type out all code examples yourself (don't just copy-paste)
- Experiment with variations of the examples
- Complete all exercises before moving to the next lesson
- Use the sample data files to practice
- Refer back to previous lessons when needed

## After This Course

You'll be ready to:
- Process CSV files in production applications
- Handle large datasets efficiently
- Build data transformation pipelines
- Debug CSV-related issues
- Choose the right tools for your specific use case
